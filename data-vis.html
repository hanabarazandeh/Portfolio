            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>University enrolment is an <a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a> tool with a series of visualizations that I designed and developed to explore post secondary enrolment patterns in Canada.
            </p>
            <p>The main goal of this project was to design a tool that makes a very large dataset into insight; more specifically, help the audience discover the relationship between different dimensions.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="para">
            <p>I will talk about a visualization in this project that I consider the most important:</p>
            <h2>International university enrolment by country of citizenship, gender, and field study, and year</h2>
            <p>I aimed to design a visualization that could find some patterns, and help find the right questions. Questions like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If some nationalities among international students are increasing faster over the years, are these values proportional to the population of those regions? </li>
                <li>If female students are increasing in STEM enrolments, is it the same rate among different nationalities?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And then I created other visualizations that try to answer those questions. </p>

                <h3>Challenge 1</h3>
                <p>Choosing the right visual encodings that reduce the cognitive load</p>
                <h3>Solution 1</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bar chart, because we are the most accurate at mapping length to a value in our brains according to Stevens power law. </li>
                    <li>Color to indicate the field of study (STEM vs BHASE), because it is best for distinguishing between discrete categories.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Challenge 2</h3>
                <p>Too many dimensions (4), difficult to observe all of these at once, with one visualization:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Number of students from different regions throughout the years.</li>
                    <li>Change in number of students from, for instance, Middle East throughout the years.</li>
                    <li>STEM vs BHASE ratio in different nationalities. </li>
                    <li>Gender ratio among different nationalities, throughout the years.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Solution 2</h3>
                <p>Interactivity: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A slider that can be used to change the year, this way we can see how the number of students from different regions change over the years dynamically.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dragging over a chart filtering the results on the other chart, this way we can see the gender ratio for different regions, in different years.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                On bottom left there is a chart that compares the number of international students from different countries at a selected year/time period. 
                Dragging mouse over this chart filters data on the chart on the right. 
                The chart on the right shows the gender ratio for total international students at a selected year/time period. 
                Color is used in both charts to show the STEM to BHASE ratio, blue for BHASE, and orange for STEM.

                the Middle East. 
                Dragging mouse over this chart filters data on the chart on the right. 
                The bar chart on the right shows the gender ratio for total international students in 2010-2011, where bar on the left is for female and the one on the right 
                is for male gender, each bar is also divided by colors, showing the STEM vs BHASE ratio for each gender in that year. 
                Color is used in both charts to show the STEM to BHASE ratio, blue for BHASE, and orange for STEM.
