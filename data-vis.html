        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>University enrolment is an <a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a> tool with a series of visualizations that I designed and developed to explore post secondary enrolment patterns in Canada.
        </p>

        <h2>Vis 2: International university enrolment</h2>
        <p>For readers convenience, I will only introduce the visualization that I find the most important in the project:</p>
        <p>Vis 2: International university enrolment by country of citizenship, gender, and field of study, throughout the years 2010-2018</p>
        <p>In this interactive visualization I intended to explore the change in the population of international students for each region as well as the STEM vs BHASE ratio for each dimension.</p>
        <p>The reason why I chose to analyze so many dimensions together in one vis was is that it raises questions that I made other visualizations to explore.</p>
        <p>
            Since this is a complex data to deal with, I decided on a highly interactive vis to enable exploration across different subsets.</p>
        <p>
            Below you can see the structure that I decided on for vis 2:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="img/viz2-structure-800.jpg" alt="the structure of visualization 2, where on top right there is a slider that moves the time range for the 2 charts on the bottoms. 
                On bottom left there is a chart that compares the number of international students from different countries at a selected year/time period. 
                Dragging mouse over this chart filters data on the chart on the right. 
                The chart on the right shows the gender ratio for total international students at a selected year/time period. 
                Color is used in both charts to show the STEM to BHASE ratio, blue for BHASE, and orange for STEM.

                    " sizes="(min-width: 75rem) 50vw,
                    100vw">
            <figcaption>the structure and interactions of vis 2</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Next decision I needed to make was the visual encodings: </p>
        <p>I decided to choose visual encodings that are easiest to comprehend for human brain, so that it does not add to the complexity of this visualization; we are the most accurate at mapping length to a value in our brains according to Stevens power
            law.
        </p>
        <p>So I decided on bar chart for both charts.</p>
        <p>And for the second visual encoding I chose color, because it is best for distinguishing between discrete categories.</p>
        <p>Below you can see the final look of vis 2:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="img/viz2-800.jpg" alt="final look of vis 2, where on top right there is a slider that moves the time range for the 2 charts on the bottoms, the current years shown are 2010-2011. 
                On bottom left there is a chart that compares the number of international students from different countries in 2010-2011, and the regions are labeled as Africa, America
                , Eastern Asia, Europe, Oceania, Other, geographical sub-region, Southeast Asia, Southern Asia, West Central Asia And
                the Middle East. 
                Dragging mouse over this chart filters data on the chart on the right. 
                The bar chart on the right shows the gender ratio for total international students in 2010-2011, where bar on the left is for female and the one on the right 
                is for male gender, each bar is also divided by colors, showing the STEM vs BHASE ratio for each gender in that year. 
                Color is used in both charts to show the STEM to BHASE ratio, blue for BHASE, and orange for STEM.

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>The main challenge I faced was finding the appropriate data that would allow me to explore the questions arose by vis 2. </p>
        <p>For instance, For visualization 5, I wanted to examine the academic performances of regions with high STEM ratio in female students (Middle East and Central and Southern Asia ). But I could not find any data on that. </p>
        <p>So instead, I used academic performance in high school for East Asian countries, which still answered the question: there is no correlation between academic performance and choosing STEM.</p>

        <h2>What I learnt</h2>
        <p>After hours and hours of looking for datasets, I learnt a valuable lesson: </p>
        <p>As designers, we won't always necessary have the perfect data, or the most solid idea given by the client to work with. And that is what makes the design process a beautiful experience: to take something complex or vague and make it simple and
            easy to understand.</p>
