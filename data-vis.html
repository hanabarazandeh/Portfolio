            <h2 class="project-h2">Overview</h2>
            <p>University enrolment is an <a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a> tool with a series of visualizations that I designed and developed to explore post secondary enrolment patterns in Canada.
            </p>
            <p>The main goal of this project was to transform a very large dataset (and some smaller related datasets) into insight; more specifically, help the audience discover the relationship between different dimensions.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="para">
            <h2 class="project-h2">Initial Problem</h2>
            <div class="inner-para">
                <p>I will talk about a visualization in this project that I consider the most important:</p>
                <h3>International university enrolment by country of citizenship, gender, and field study, and year</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="inner-para">
                <p>I aimed to design a visualization that could find some patterns, and help find the right questions, questions like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If some nationalities among international students are increasing faster over the years, are these values proportional to the population of those regions? </li>
                    <li>If female students are less likely to choose STEM, what are some possible reasons?</li>
                    <li>If female students are increasing in STEM enrolments, is it the same rate among different nationalities?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And then I could create other visualizations that try to answer those questions. But first there were challenges to overcome before I could achieve that; I needed to tackle too many dimensions (5 dimensions) in one visualization. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="inner-para">
                <p>I explored different types of charts, such as the one below which is a draft I made in Tableau, but they were not helping with making the data more understandable.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/draft.png" alt="a screenshot of a draft of the visualization, where country of citizenship and year are mapped to the x axis, 
            the number is mapped to the y axis, and color is used to indicate gender. Dark blue is for female and orange for male gender.
            The legend is shown on top right.">
                    <figcaption>draft of the visualization</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Some problems with this draft:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>difficult to compare the number of different nationalities in a given year, like 2013</li>
                    <li>difficult to compare gender ratio of a nationality with another, in a given year</li>
                    <li>color works great for indicating gender, but what about STEM vs BHASE? it would be too complicated to have 2 visual encodings for 2 categorical dimensions.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>


        <section class="para">
            <h2 class="project-h2">Process</h2>
            <p>I came up with the following solutions for the stated problems:</p>

            <section class="inner-para">
                <h3>The right visual encodings that reduce the cognitive load</h3>
                <ul>
                    <div class="grid two-column">
                        <li>Bar chart where number of students by nationality and gender are mapped to y axis, because we are the most accurate at mapping length to a value in our brains according to Stevens power law. </li>
                        <img src="img/vis-sketch.png">
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid two-column">
                        <li>Color to indicate the field of study (STEM vs BHASE), because it is best for distinguishing between discrete categories.</li>
                        <img src="img/colors.png">
                    </div>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="inner-para">
                <h3>2 facets</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 facets allowed me to use less visual encodings: 2 simple facets instead of one complex one. I did not have to use a new one for gender, instead I used length just like with nationality. </li>
                    <li>
                        2 facets created the oppurtunity for interactivity, which itself was another solution.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                    <li>
                        A slider that can be used to change the year, this way we can see how the number of students from different regions change over the years dynamically.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dragging over a chart filtering the results on the other chart, this way we can see the gender ratio for different regions, in different years.

                </ul>

            <figure>
                <img src="img/viz2-800.jpg" alt="final look of vis 2, where on top right there is a slider that moves the time range for the 2 charts on the bottoms, the current years shown are 2010-2011. 
                    On bottom left there is a chart that compares the number of international students from different countries in 2010-2011, and the regions are labeled as Africa, America
                    , Eastern Asia, Europe, Oceania, Other, geographical sub-region, Southeast Asia, Southern Asia, West Central Asia And
                    the Middle East. 
                    Dragging mouse over this chart filters data on the chart on the right. 
                    The bar chart on the right shows the gender ratio for total international students in 2010-2011, where bar on the left is for female and the one on the right 
                    is for male gender, each bar is also divided by colors, showing the STEM vs BHASE ratio for each gender in that year. 
                    Color is used in both charts to show the STEM to BHASE ratio, blue for BHASE, and orange for STEM.
