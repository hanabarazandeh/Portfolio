            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>University enrolment is an <a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a> tool with a series of visualizations that I designed and developed to explore post secondary enrolment patterns in Canada.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="para">
            <h2>Vis 2: International university enrolment</h2>
            <h3>My first step after research and data cleaning</h3>
            <p>design a visualization that shows the relationship between different dimensions: vis 2</p>
            <p>Vis 2: International university enrolment by country of citizenship, gender, and field of study, throughout the years 2010-2018</p>
            <h3>The purpose of vis 2</h3>
            <p>find the right questions regarding the data. Then I created other visualizations that try to answer those questions. </p>
            <h3>Challenge 1</h3>
            <p>Choosing the right visual encodings that reduce the cognitive load</p>
            <h3>Solution 1</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Bar chart, because we are the most accurate at mapping length to a value in our brains according to Stevens power law. </li>
                <li>Color, because it is best for distinguishing between discrete categories.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Challenge 2</h3>
            <p>Too many dimensions (4), difficult to observe all of these at once, with one visualization:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Number of students from different regions throughout the years.</li>
                <li>Change in number of students from, for instance, Middle East throughout the years.</li>
                <li>STEM vs BHASE ratio in different nationalities. </li>
                <li>Gender ratio among different nationalities, throughout the years.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Solution 2</h3>
            <p>Interactivity: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A slider that can be used to change the year, this way we can see how the number of students from different regions change over the years dynamically.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dragging over a chart filtering the results on the other chart, this way we can see the gender ratio for different regions, in different years.
                </li>
            </ul>

                On bottom left there is a chart that compares the number of international students from different countries at a selected year/time period. 
                Dragging mouse over this chart filters data on the chart on the right. 
                The chart on the right shows the gender ratio for total international students at a selected year/time period. 
                Color is used in both charts to show the STEM to BHASE ratio, blue for BHASE, and orange for STEM.

                On bottom left there is a chart that compares the number of international students from different countries in 2010-2011, and the regions are labeled as Africa, America
                , Eastern Asia, Europe, Oceania, Other, geographical sub-region, Southeast Asia, Southern Asia, West Central Asia And
                the Middle East. 
                Dragging mouse over this chart filters data on the chart on the right. 
                The bar chart on the right shows the gender ratio for total international students in 2010-2011, where bar on the left is for female and the one on the right 
                is for male gender, each bar is also divided by colors, showing the STEM vs BHASE ratio for each gender in that year. 
                Color is used in both charts to show the STEM to BHASE ratio, blue for BHASE, and orange for STEM.
